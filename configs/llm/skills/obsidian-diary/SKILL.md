# Obsidian Diary & Note Organizer

## Description
This skill acts as an intelligent secretary for your Obsidian knowledge base. It takes raw content from `Tools/chat/daily summary.md` and put it into the right place, when compiling the content, it follows following steps:
1.  Formats it according to your `Tools/chat/daily summary.md` prompt.
2.  Appends diary entries to `Logging/Daily/`.
3.  Identifies people, resolves their aliases, and updates their files in `People/`.
4.  Extracts knowledge points to relevant documents.

You should process the raw content one section at a time, usually by day. Do not compile all sections together in a single batch.

## Workflow

### 1. Context Loading
    - Read the file `Tools/chat/daily summary.md` in the vault. Follow the prompt and instructions at the top of that file to decide how to summarize and format the text.  
    - The raw content that needs to be compiled is found in the `User` section.

### 2. Entity Resolution (Crucial)
Before writing, you must identify who is mentioned in the text.
-   **Step 1**: Run the `obsidian-people` skill to get a master list of names and aliases.
    ```bash
    ~/.gemini/skills/obsidian-people/run.sh <PATH_TO_VAULT_ROOT>
    ```
-   **Step 2**: Analyze the raw text. Match any names, nicknames, or references (e.g., "Jim", "Boss") to the **canonical filenames** returned by the script (e.g., "Jim" might match `People/James.md` via an alias).

### 3. Execution (File Editing)

#### A. Update Daily Log
-   **Target**: `Logging/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (Use today's date).
-   **Action**: 
    1.  Read the file to understand its current structure.
    2.  move the raw content to the diary.
    3.  add the compiled content to the diary (Please follow the instructions in `Tools/chat/daily summary.md`).

#### B. Update People Files
-   **Target**: The matched `People/<CanonicalName>.md` files.
-   **Action**: 
    1.  For each person mentioned, extract the relevant context or information about them.
    2.  Read their file.
    3.  **Append** a new entry (e.g., a bullet point with today's date link `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]`) containing this info.
    4. Leave a tag like `#p/...` to that people file.

#### C. Knowledge & Concepts
-   **Target**: Relevant topic files (search for them if needed) or new files.
-   **Action**: Append or insert the structured knowledge points.

#### D. Remove the compiled text from the raw text
-   **Target**: The compiled raw text in `Tools/chat/daily summary.md`.

## Example Usage
> User: "Today I met with Lao Wang, we discussed the new AI project structure. Also, I realized that RAG requires better chunking strategies."

**Agent Actions**:
1.  Read `Tools/chat/daily summary.md`.
2.  Run `obsidian-people/run.sh`. Find that "Lao Wang" is an alias for `People/Wang Xiaoming.md`.
3.  **Update `Logging/Daily/202X-XX-XX.md`**: Append the meeting note and the realization about RAG.
4.  **Update `People/Wang Xiaoming.md`**: Append "- [[202X-XX-XX]]: Discussed AI project structure."
5.  **Update `RAG.md` (or similar)**: Append the note about chunking strategies.


## Tips
The text in `Tools/chat/daily summary.md` is generated by speech recognition, so it may not be perfect.
So try to align the people mentioned in the text with the canonical names in `People/` directory. But don't change the content in `People/`
