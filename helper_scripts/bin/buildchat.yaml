  Previously, you have a script like this:
  ```python
  {{ prev_code }}
  ```

  It's according running stdout is:
  ```
  {{ prev_stdout }}
  ```

  After improving the solution, you have a script like this:
  ```python
  {{ curr_code }}
  ```

  It's according running stdout is:
  ```
  {{ curr_stdout }}
  ```

  The prediction performance and related information are demonstrated in the stdout.
  I want to understand how the prediction performance are greatly improved.
  Please pay attention to the following points:
  - Is the prediction target changed?
  - Is the metric changed?

    请总结这篇文章，主要内容包含两个部分
    1. 如果只聚焦在 **方法设计** 本身的亮点（不讨论跨领域成果与应用表现），归纳文章亮点
    2. 验证方法的有效性，它选取了什么场景用于评测，每个场景试用的指标是什么意思？请用表格形式展示
    3. 和哪些Baseline做了比较，在方法设计上（而不是实验结果），现在的方法比baseline更好？

    每个关键点后都接一个[<原文内容>]的引用(如果有图表也要引用)，方便我Ctrl+F查找。

  I want to understand how the prediction performance and labels are measured when creating the "score.csv".
  Please give a clear and precise explanation using mathematical expressions.
