  Previously, you have a script like this:
  ```python
  {{ prev_code }}
  ```

  It's according running stdout is:
  ```
  {{ prev_stdout }}
  ```

  After improving the solution, you have a script like this:
  ```python
  {{ curr_code }}
  ```

  It's according running stdout is:
  ```
  {{ curr_stdout }}
  ```
