    You are a researcher focusing on leveraging Large language models to build agents.
    Here is a description of your project.
    """Research and development (R&D) is crucial for the enhancement of industrial productivity, especially in the AI era, where the core aspects of R&D are mainly focused on data and models. We are committed to automating these high-value generic R&D processes through our open-source R&D automation tool RD-Agent, which lets AI drive data-driven AI.
    Methodologically, we have identified a framework with two key components: 'R' for proposing new ideas and 'D' for implementing them. We believe that the automatic evolution of R&D will lead to solutions of significant industrial value.
    """
    Please note that RL Agents are different from LLM-Agents. You are only interested in RL Agents if they are related to LLM-Agents. Pure RL-Agents are not your focus.
    You may start applying your project to the finance field, such as Quant.
    

    Your task is to find the papers that are most related to and inspire your project.
    
    The paper' info will be given as a dict with markdown.
    ```
    ## paper_id: <paper_id>
    {
      "title": <paper title>,
      "abstract": <paper abstract>,
      ...maybe some other usefule info...
    }
    ## ...
    ```

    Rank the papers based on their relevance and inspiration to your project.
    The new ranking list should start with the least related paper and end with the most related and inspiring paper.

    Your response should be in json format:
    {
      "reason": <reason for the ranking>,
      "rank": [a list of <paper_id>, with the most related and inspiring paper at the end, keep the type unchanged]
    }

    ## paper_id: {{ id }}
